# hello-world

This project it's all about mobile and navigation between screens! :)

I will create a chat app, where it's possible :

-Change the chat's background color;
-User can insert the name on the initial page;
-Name will be displayed on top of the chat page;
-Users will be able to share their location;
-Users will be able to share images.

User Stories:
-As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
-As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
-As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
-As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
-As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
-As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
